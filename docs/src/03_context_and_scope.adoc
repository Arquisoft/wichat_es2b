== Context and Scope


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

=== 3.2 Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

### **Explanation of technical interfaces** ðŸ“ƒ

The application follows a **hexagonal architecture pattern**, with the following components:

#### **Agent User (External User)**

- The user interacts with the **Web App**, which serves as the frontend interface.

#### **Web App (Frontend Layer)**

- Sends **requests** to and receives **responses** from the **Gateway Service**.
- Acts as a bridge between the external user and the backend services.

#### **Gateway Service (API Gateway & Central Layer)**

- Central hub that manages communication between different services.
- Handles authentication, user management, and interaction with external components.
- Uses **JPA (Java Persistence API)** to interact with the **MySQL database**.

#### **Domain (Business Logic Layer)**

- Contains core business logic.
- Works closely with the **Gateway Service** to process requests.

#### **Services Layer (Microservices Architecture)**

- **User Service**: Manages user-related operations.
- **Auth Service**: Handles authentication and authorization.
- **LLM Service**: Interfaces with a Large Language Model (LLM) for AI-driven responses.

#### **Database Layer (Persistent Storage)**
- **MySQL Database**: Stores application data, accessed via **JPA**.

#### **Technical Interfaces**
- **Web App & Gateway Service**: HTTP Requests/Responses.
- **Gateway Service & Services Layer (User, Auth, LLM Services)**: REST API or gRPC communication.
- **Gateway Service & MySQL**: JPA-based database interaction.
- **Gateway Service & Domain**: Internal service calls.
