== Solution Strategy

What follows is a short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape our system's architecture

=== Technology
* **Visual Studio Code** as a IDE due to its versatility in developing applications with different programming languages and its compatibility with Git.

* **Docker** to deploy the project, as it allows for the definition of consistent execution environments, ensuring that the application runs the same way in development, testing, and production. Additionally, it supports continuous deployment.

* **GitHub Pages** for deploying the documentation.

* **MongoDB** as a database due to its flexibility when implementing new properties in schemas without having to redo the "tables" every time a new property is added.

* **Azure portal** to deploy the application on the internet due to its ease of configuration, following the instructions provided to developers for deployment, and its potential to install Docker for deploying the Docker containers created in continuous deployment.

=== High-level decomposition
|===
| *Quality goal* | *Scenario* | *Solution approach* | *Link to Details*
| Usability | A new user quickly understands how to play and how to ask for basic hints. | Intuitive interface, interactive tutorial, clear design of the interface for interacting with the predefined hint system. | [Link to UI/UX Documentation]
| Performance | The game loads images and predefined hints in under 1 second. | Image optimization, predefined hint caching, use of CDN for static resources. | [Link to Performance Optimization Documentation]
| Hint Accuracy | Predefined hints are relevant and help players progress. | Creation of a set of well-designed and reviewed hints for each image, validation with user testing. | [Link to Hint Design Documentation]
| Testability | Developers can run automated tests to verify game functionality. | Modular code design, implementation of unit and integration tests, use of testing frameworks. | [Link to Testability Documentation]

=== Approaches to achieve quality objectives

|===
| *Quality goal* | *Scenario* | *Solution approach* | *Link to Details*
| Usability | Players on different devices enjoy a consistent experience. | Responsive CSS design, cross-browser and device testing, use of responsive UI frameworks. | [Link to Responsive Design Documentation]
| Performance | The game maintains a smooth experience with multiple concurrent players. | Scalable backend with Docker and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), load balancing, database query optimization. | [Link to Scalability Documentation]
| Hint Accuracy | Predefined hints are clear and do not generate confusion. | Careful wording of hints, usability testing with real players, feedback system to improve hints. | [Link to Hint Design Documentation]
| Testability | Code changes do not introduce regressions. | Continuous integration with automated testing, adequate code coverage, test documentation. | [Link to Automated Testing Documentation]

=== Relevant organizational decisions
Currently, we have been meeting once a week, although this may change in the future depending on the team's needs to address different topics during development.

In most meetings, if not all, all group members participate, and we discuss opinions on different designs and implementations of the application.

We also have a WhatsApp group as a fast messaging channel.
