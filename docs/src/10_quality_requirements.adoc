== Quality Requirements


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header" cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| Quality Attribute | Scenario | Motivation | Expected Response

| Performance
| A user requests a hint from the LLM and expects a fast response.
| Avoid delays that could affect the overall experience.
| The LLM responds fast enough so the user isn't kept waiting for it.

| Security
| A user attempts to access another user's information without authorization.
| Protect users' privacy and data confidentiality.
| The system denies the request and logs the unauthorized access attempt.

| Usability
| A new user accesses the application and must start a game within reasonable time.
| Ensure a low learning curve and an intuitive experience.
| The user quickly finds the main options without external documentation.

| Maintainability
| Some collaborator is trying to edit, fix or add a new functionality to the app.
| Ensure the changes can be done seamlessly without having to refactor or edit other areas of the code.
| The application continues functioning correctly after the changes thanks t a division of the functionality in blocks.

| Compatibility
| The app is opened in different devices with varying form factors.
| Ensure the game remains functional and all elements are correctly displayed.
| The app adapts to the form factor of the user device without impacting the
experience.

| Reliability
| The app has been available for a long time.
| Ensure the app continues to work even after it's dependencies have been updated allowing it to work correctly over time.
| The app keeps working correctly without any apparent or changes to it.

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
