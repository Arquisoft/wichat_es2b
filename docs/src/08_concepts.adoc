== Cross-cutting Concepts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

== 8.1. Application Architecture
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.1.1. Hexagonal Architecture
| The application follows a hexagonal architecture pattern, separating the different layers: frontend, business logic, microservices, and persistent storage.

| 8.1.2. Communication Between Components
| Each component, such as the web app, Gateway Service, and microservices, communicates using technologies like HTTP and REST. This ensures smooth, scalable interaction.

| 8.1.3. Presentation Layer
| web app serves as the entry point for external users, allowing interaction with the application and routing requests through the Gateway Service.
|===

== 8.2. Integration with Microservices
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.2.1. Communication Between Microservices
| Microservices communicate via REST, enabling flexible integration and handling different functionalities.

| 8.2.2. Scalability Through Microservices
| Microservices architecture allows independent scaling of services without affecting other parts of the app.
|===

== 8.3. Data Persistence and Management
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.3.1. Database Interaction
| The Gateway Service uses JPA to interact with MySQL, ensuring efficient and secure data management.

| 8.3.2. Data Backup
| The MySQL database should be configured for automatic backups, ensuring data integrity and recovery in case of failure.
|===

== 8.4. LLM Service
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.4.1. LLM Service
| The LLM Service is a microservice that interacts with a Large Language Model, generating text or performing language-related tasks based on user input.
|===

== 8.5. Testeability
[cols="3,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.5.1. Unit Tests
| Verify that each individual unit or component of the application functions correctly.
| 8.5.2. Integration Tests
| Check the interaction between different units or components of the application.
| 8.5.3. Functional Tests
| Verify that the application meets the specified functional requirements.
| 8.5.4. Security Tests
| Identify vulnerabilities and ensure the protection of sensitive data.
|===

== 8.6. Usability
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.6.1. Usability
| Usability ensures products are easy and efficient to use, leading to user satisfaction.  We'll prioritize an intuitive design, clear navigation, and accessibility, with a particular focus on making our app user-friendly and requiring a low learning curve.
|===

== 8.7. Maintainability & Scalability
[cols="2,2", options="header"]
|===
| **Concept** | **Description**

| 8.7.1. Maintainability
| Focuses on how easily software can be modified, fixed, or improved over time. Good maintainability reduces costs and effort for future changes.
| 8.7.2. Scalability
| Addresses the ability of a system to handle increased load or growth. A scalable system can adapt to more users, data, or transactions without significant performance degradation.
