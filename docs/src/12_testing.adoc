== Testing

Software quality is a critical aspect of the development lifecycle. To ensure this quality, a combination of automated testing strategies and static code analysis has been implemented. This section outlines the unit tests, code coverage, security hotspots, and provides an introduction to end-to-end (E2E) testing.

=== Unit Tests, Code Coverage & Security Hotspots

To verify the correct behavior of individual modules, unit tests have been developed using tools appropriate for the project's technology stack. These tests cover both business logic and key utility functions.

Code coverage and static analysis were performed using SonarQube, with the following results:

* **Code coverage:** 89.9% on 952 lines of code.
* **Security hotspots:** 18 identified, pending review and classification.
* **Code duplication:** 0.3%, indicating a very low level of redundancy.
* **Code quality:** The project passed the *Quality Gate* with an "A" rating in security, reliability, and maintainability.

This level of coverage and quality provides high confidence in the stability of the system's components.

=== E2E Tests

In addition to unit testing, end-to-end (E2E) tests are being developed to validate complete user flowsâ€”from the user interface through to the backend. These tests aim to ensure that all components of the system integrate properly and behave as expected under various usage conditions.

=== Stability Testing

Stability is a critical aspect of the development process, ensuring that the system can handle expected loads and perform reliably over time. This includes testing for memory leaks, performance under stress, and overall system resilience.

Here we can see the results of the stability tests performed on the system over time:
