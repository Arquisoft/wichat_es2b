== Introduction and Goals

This project aims to develop an interactive web application,
where users are given an image of a place and a series of options
to try and guess where this place might be.
The key innovation of the project relies on the integration of a Large Language Model (LLM),
allowing users to interact with an AI assistant to request hints about the location.
This mechanic enhances the gameplay by offering contextual clues, improving accessibility,
and creating a more engaging user experience.

=== Requirements Overview

The application must meet the following functional and non-functional requirements.

Functional Requirements:

- Users must be able to access the application through a web interface.
- Users must be able to create an account and log in.
- System must be able of displaying an image and options.
- Users must be able to communicate with an LLM for hints about their location.
- System must set a time limit to answer the given question.
- The application must allow users to submit their guess.
- Users must be able to review their past games.
- The system must provide APIs for managing users and game data.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

[options="header", cols="1,2"]
|===
| Goal         | Description
| Usability   | The application must be intuitive and allow seamless navigation and interaction.
| Performance | The system should respond promptly to user actions, ensuring smooth gameplay.
| Security    | User authentication and data storage must be handled securely.
| Scalability | The architecture must support a growing number of users without performance degradation.
| Accessibility | The application must be accessible to users with different needs, including colorblind-friendly design and screen reader compatibility.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
