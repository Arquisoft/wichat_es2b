== Architecture Decisions

During the application development process, a series of decisions may change due to issues encountered during development, research on the technologies to be used, exploration of different work/organization strategies, etc.

These decisions are discussed in personal meetings and recorded in the meeting minutes, with some of the most important decisions being the following:

=== Main Framework

7/02/2024

**Description:** The main programming language for the application's development will be JavaScript, but we are unsure if we will need to develop certain modules in another programming language.

**Decision taken:** Due to the need for the framework to be versatile in handling multiple possible programming languages, we have decided to use the Visual Studio Code framework.


=== Front-End

7/02/2024

**Description:** The main way for users to interact with the system and the part which will be deployer

**Decision taken:** The most likely candidate for its implementation is react, yet it is still up for debate.


=== Back-End

7/02/2024

**Description:** The inner workings of the application which will not be for the clients to use and see.

**Decision taken:** The most likely candidate for its implementation is a relational database and a Javascript framework, yet it is still up for debate.


=== LLM

7/02/2024

**Description:** The Language modules will be used for the hint generation in the application thus will be one we'll need to choose

**Decision taken:** There had been no advancement in this decision.
